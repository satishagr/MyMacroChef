# Food Delivery Website
MyMacroChef is a Personalized Meal Subscription web-app which suggests meals and delivers them. The calorie intake is estimated using The Harris-Benedict equation based on BMI and other attributes of the user. Based on userâ€™s preferences, Amazon Sagemaker suggests weekly plans to the user. The App is integrated with Amazon Alexa for user's convenience and also providing accessibility to differently abled people. This application has future scope to integrate ingredient selection and recipe manipulation, which would open a whole new doorway of cooking meals using robotics, NLP and machine learning.
The technology stack is JavaScript, JQuery, Python, Node.js, Amazon S3, Amazon Alexa, Google Maps API, SageMaker, DynamoDB, Lambda Server, Cloudwatch, SNS, SES, Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon API Gateway, Cognito.
